##  Basic Go REST Server

This project demonstrates a basic REST server in Go. The server exposes a single endpoint, `/users`, which can be used to create, read, update, and delete users.

To run the server, simply execute the following command:

`go run server.go`

The server will then be listening on port 8080. You can then use a variety of tools, such as curl or Postman, to send requests to the server. automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**
